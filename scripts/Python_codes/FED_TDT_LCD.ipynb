    "1. **V0 (Contrast Pin)**: Connect this pin to **GND** for a basic setup. If the contrast isn't satisfactory (i.e., the characters are either too dark or not visible), you can insert a fixed resistor (around 1k立) between `V0` and **GND**. This resistor helps to reduce the contrast slightly.\n",
