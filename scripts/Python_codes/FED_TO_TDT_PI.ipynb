    "Once you have installed the Raspberry Pi OS using Method 1 (with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse), transferring the Python code to the Raspberry Pi and running it is straightforward. Here’s how you can do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Connect the Raspberry Pi to the Internet\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Connect to Wi-Fi or Ethernet**:\n",
    "   - During the initial setup, you'll have the option to connect the Raspberry Pi to a Wi-Fi network. Alternatively, you can connect it via Ethernet.\n",
    "   - Ensure the Raspberry Pi is connected to the internet so you can download any necessary packages and transfer files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Transfer the Python Script to the Raspberry Pi\n",
    "\n",
    "You have several options to transfer the Python script from your computer to the Raspberry Pi:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 1: Using a USB Drive\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Copy the Script to a USB Drive**:\n",
    "   - Copy your Python script (e.g., `fed_to_tdt.py`) to a USB drive.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Insert the USB Drive into the Raspberry Pi**:\n",
    "   - Insert the USB drive into one of the Raspberry Pi’s USB ports.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Access the USB Drive on the Raspberry Pi**:\n",

    "   - Open the file manager, find your USB drive, and copy the Python script to the desired location on your Raspberry Pi (e.g., `/home/pi/`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 2: Using SCP (Secure Copy Protocol)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ensure SSH is Enabled**:\n",
    "   - If not already enabled, you can enable SSH on the Raspberry Pi by opening a terminal and running:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     sudo raspi-config\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Navigate to \"Interfacing Options\" > \"SSH\" and enable it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use SCP to Transfer the Script**:\n",
    "   - From your computer (Linux/Mac) or using an SCP client like WinSCP (on Windows), you can transfer the file:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     scp /path/to/your/script.py pi@<Raspberry_Pi_IP_address>:/home/pi/\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Replace `/path/to/your/script.py` with the path to your Python script and `<Raspberry_Pi_IP_address>` with the Raspberry Pi's IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 3: Downloading the Script from a Web Source (e.g., GitHub)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use wget or curl to Download**:\n",
    "   - If your Python script is hosted online (e.g., on GitHub), you can download it directly to the Raspberry Pi:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     wget https://path-to-your-script.com/script.py\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - This command downloads the file to your current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Install Required Python Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open a Terminal on the Raspberry Pi**:\n",
    "   - You can do this by clicking on the terminal icon on the Raspberry Pi desktop.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install the Required Libraries**:\n",
    "   - Install any Python libraries required by your script:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     sudo apt-get update\n",
    "     sudo apt-get install python3-rpi.gpio python3-serial\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Run the Python Script\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Navigate to the Script Location**:\n",
    "   - If you placed the script in `/home/pi/`, you can navigate there:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     cd /home/pi/\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run the Script**:\n",
    "   - Run the Python script using:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     python3 script.py\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Replace `script.py` with the name of your Python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Automate the Script to Run on Boot (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want the script to run automatically when the Raspberry Pi starts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Edit rc.local**:\n",
    "   - Open the `rc.local` file:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     sudo nano /etc/rc.local\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Add the following line before `exit 0`:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     python3 /home/pi/script.py &\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Save and exit (`CTRL+X`, `Y`, then `Enter`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reboot to Test**:\n",
    "   - Reboot your Raspberry Pi to see if the script runs automatically:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     sudo reboot\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transfer the Script**: Use a USB drive, SCP, or download directly to transfer your Python script to the Raspberry Pi.\n",
    "- **Install Dependencies**: Ensure all necessary Python libraries are installed.\n",
    "- **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script manually or set it to run on boot for automation.\n",
