    "\n",
    "### Key Changes and Improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Thread Safety with Global Variables**:\n",
    "   - Introduced a `pellet_lock` (`threading.Lock()`) to ensure thread-safe access to the `pellet_in_well` variable.\n",
    "   - Wrapped access to `pellet_in_well` within `with pellet_lock:` blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exception Handling for Serial Communication**:\n",
    "   - Added `try...except` blocks around serial port operations to catch and log exceptions like `serial.SerialException`.\n",
    "   - Ensured that the serial port is closed properly in the `finally` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Graceful Shutdown and GPIO Cleanup**:\n",
    "   - Used a `stop_event` (`threading.Event()`) to signal threads to stop when a `KeyboardInterrupt` occurs.\n",
    "   - In the main thread, upon interruption, set the `stop_event` and joined all threads before cleaning up GPIO pins.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Timestamp Accuracy**:\n",
    "   - Modified the `process_event` function to use the timestamp from the FED3 data (`data_list[0]`) instead of generating a new timestamp. This ensures more accurate event timing.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Validation and Parsing**:\n",
    "   - Added checks to ensure that the data list has at least 10 elements before accessing `data_list[9]` to avoid `IndexError`.\n",
    "   - Logged warnings when received data is incomplete or does not match expected length.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Resource Management for Serial Ports**:\n",
    "   - Ensured that serial ports are closed when threads terminate, using `ser.close()` in the `finally` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Logging Instead of Print Statements**:\n",
    "   - Replaced all `print` statements with `logging` calls, providing more control over log levels and formatting.\n",
    "   - Configured the logging format to include timestamps and log levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Error Handling in Threads**:\n",
    "   - Wrapped the main logic in the `read_from_fed` function within a `try...except` block to catch and log any exceptions that occur within the thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Handling Multiple FED Devices**:\n",
    "   - The code is structured to handle multiple FED devices by starting a new thread for each serial port specified in the `fed_ports` dictionary.\n",
    "   - Each thread handles its own serial port and shared resources are managed with thread-safe mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Graceful Thread Termination**:\n",
    "    - Threads check the `stop_event` flag in their loops and exit gracefully when the event is set.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Ensuring GPIO Cleanup**:\n",
    "    - Moved `GPIO.cleanup()` into the `finally` block to ensure it executes regardless of how the script exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Code Organization and Modularity**:\n",
    "    - Organized the code into functions for better readability and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Serial Port Detection**:\n",
    "  - The code still uses hardcoded serial ports. For a more robust solution, consider implementing dynamic detection of connected FED devices or using persistent device naming (e.g., by device ID or symbolic links).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exception Handling**:\n",
    "  - In the `read_from_fed` function, exceptions are logged but the thread continues running unless a critical error occurs, ensuring robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logging Levels**:\n",
    "  - Adjust the logging level in `logging.basicConfig()` to control the verbosity of the logs (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python Version**:\n",
    "  - Added the shebang line `#!/usr/bin/env python3` at the top of the script to specify that it should be run with Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Thread Cleanup**:\n",
    "  - The main thread waits for all worker threads to finish by calling `t.join()` on each thread after setting the `stop_event`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resource Management**:\n",
    "  - The serial port is closed in the `finally` block, ensuring that it is closed even if an error occurs during execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please replace `/dev/ttyACM0` and `FED1` in the `fed_ports` dictionary with the actual serial ports and identifiers for your devices.\n"
