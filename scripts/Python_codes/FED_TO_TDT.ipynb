    "Using a **DB25** connector can be an effective way to manage multiple signals from your Arduino to the TDT system while reducing the number of individual BNC cables required. A DB25 connector has 25 pins, allowing you to send multiple signals through a single, organized cable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use a DB25 Connector with Arduino and TDT:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **DB25 Connector Overview**:\n",
    "   - **25 Pins**: The DB25 connector has 25 pins, which can be used to transmit multiple signals (e.g., digital outputs from the Arduino) and ground connections through a single cable.\n",
    "   - **Custom Cable**: You would typically create or purchase a custom DB25 cable that breaks out the individual wires from the DB25 connector to individual BNC connectors or directly to the TDT system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Wiring Multiple FEDs to a DB25 Connector**:\n",
    "   - **Signal Assignment**: Assign each signal (event) from your Arduino to a separate pin on the DB25 connector.\n",
    "   - **Shared Ground**: Use one or more pins on the DB25 connector for ground connections, which can be shared among all signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example Pin Assignment**:\n",
    "   - Suppose you have 4 FEDs, each generating 5 events. You can assign 20 pins on the DB25 connector for these signals.\n",
    "   - **Pin 1-5**: FED 1 (Left Poke, Right Poke, Pellet, LeftWithPellet, RightWithPellet)\n",
    "   - **Pin 6-10**: FED 2\n",
    "   - **Pin 11-15**: FED 3\n",
    "   - **Pin 16-20**: FED 4\n",
    "   - **Pin 21-25**: Ground or additional signals if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Connecting to TDT**:\n",
    "   - **DB25 to BNC Breakout**: Use a DB25 to BNC breakout cable or panel, which converts the signals from the DB25 connector to individual BNC connectors that can be connected to the TDT system.\n",
    "   - **Direct Connection**: If the TDT system supports DB25 inputs, you can directly connect the DB25 cable to the TDT system, reducing the need for multiple BNC connectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Advantages**:\n",
    "   - **Organized Wiring**: Reduces the clutter and complexity of using many individual BNC cables.\n",
    "   - **Scalability**: Easy to add more signals or reassign pins without redoing all the wiring.\n",
    "   - **Shared Ground**: Simplifies grounding by allowing multiple signals to share a common ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Considerations**:\n",
    "   - **Signal Integrity**: Ensure that the length and quality of the DB25 cable maintain signal integrity, especially if the cable runs are long.\n",
    "   - **TDT Compatibility**: Confirm that your TDT system can accept the signal levels and types you're sending through the DB25 connector.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Schematic:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Arduino Pin 9** -> **DB25 Pin 1** (Left Poke from FED 1)\n",
    "- **Arduino Pin 10** -> **DB25 Pin 2** (LeftWithPellet from FED 1)\n",
    "- **Arduino Pin 11** -> **DB25 Pin 3** (Right Poke from FED 1)\n",
    "- **Arduino Pin 12** -> **DB25 Pin 4** (RightWithPellet from FED 1)\n",
    "- **Arduino Pin 13** -> **DB25 Pin 5** (Pellet Intake from FED 1)\n",
    "- Repeat for FED 2, FED 3, and FED 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ground** -> **DB25 Pin 21-25** (Shared Ground)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "Using a DB25 connector allows you to consolidate multiple signals into a single, manageable cable, making your setup with the TDT system more organized and scalable. It's especially useful when dealing with multiple FEDs or many signals, as it minimizes the number of BNC cables required and simplifies wiring."

    "\n",
    "1. **Modify the Python Script**: \n",
    "   - Update the Python script to handle as many FEDs as you have. Each FED should have its own set of events (e.g., Left Poke, Right Poke, etc.).\n",

    "### Step 2: Wiring the Arduino Mega to BNC Connectors\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Connect Each Pin to a BNC Connector**:\n",
    "   - **Signal Wire**: Connect each Arduino digital pin (e.g., pins 2 through 21) to the center conductor of a male BNC connector.\n",
    "   - **Ground**: Connect the Arduino GND to the outer shield of each BNC connector. You can use multiple ground connections, or you can tie all grounds together if the BNC connectors share a common ground.\n",

    "### Step 3: Connecting BNCs to a DB25 Connector\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **DB25 Breakout Board**:\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Wiring the BNC Connectors to the DB25**:\n",
    "   - **Signal Wires**: Connect each signal wire from the BNC connectors to the corresponding pin on the DB25 breakout board.\n",
    "   - **Ground Wires**: Connect the ground wires from all BNC connectors to one or more ground pins on the DB25 breakout board (e.g., pins 21-25).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Assemble the DB25 Connector**:\n",
    "   - Once all wires are connected to the DB25 breakout board, assemble the DB25 connector and secure it to the cable or panel that will connect to the TDT system.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **DB25 to TDT**:\n",
    "   - Connect the DB25 connector to the TDT system's input port (if available).\n",
    "   - If the TDT system doesn't have a DB25 input, use a DB25 to BNC breakout cable or panel to convert the DB25 signals back to BNC for connection to the TDT system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Testing**:\n",
    "   - Test the setup by triggering events from the FEDs and ensuring that the corresponding signals are correctly received by the TDT system.\n",

    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "By using a DB25 connector, you can consolidate many signals into a single, organized connection, making it easier to manage multiple FEDs. The Arduino Mega’s additional pins allow you to scale the system, and the DB25 connector simplifies the wiring to the TDT system."
