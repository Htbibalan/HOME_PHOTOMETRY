    "\n",
    "### Key Changes and Improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Thread Safety with Global Variables**:\n",
    "   - Introduced a `pellet_lock` (`threading.Lock()`) to ensure thread-safe access to the `pellet_in_well` variable.\n",
    "   - Wrapped access to `pellet_in_well` within `with pellet_lock:` blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exception Handling for Serial Communication**:\n",
    "   - Added `try...except` blocks around serial port operations to catch and log exceptions like `serial.SerialException`.\n",
    "   - Ensured that the serial port is closed properly in the `finally` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Graceful Shutdown and GPIO Cleanup**:\n",
    "   - Used a `stop_event` (`threading.Event()`) to signal threads to stop when a `KeyboardInterrupt` occurs.\n",
    "   - In the main thread, upon interruption, set the `stop_event` and joined all threads before cleaning up GPIO pins.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Timestamp Accuracy**:\n",
    "   - Modified the `process_event` function to use the timestamp from the FED3 data (`data_list[0]`) instead of generating a new timestamp. This ensures more accurate event timing.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Validation and Parsing**:\n",
    "   - Added checks to ensure that the data list has at least 10 elements before accessing `data_list[9]` to avoid `IndexError`.\n",
    "   - Logged warnings when received data is incomplete or does not match expected length.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Resource Management for Serial Ports**:\n",
    "   - Ensured that serial ports are closed when threads terminate, using `ser.close()` in the `finally` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Logging Instead of Print Statements**:\n",
    "   - Replaced all `print` statements with `logging` calls, providing more control over log levels and formatting.\n",
    "   - Configured the logging format to include timestamps and log levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Error Handling in Threads**:\n",
    "   - Wrapped the main logic in the `read_from_fed` function within a `try...except` block to catch and log any exceptions that occur within the thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Handling Multiple FED Devices**:\n",
    "   - The code is structured to handle multiple FED devices by starting a new thread for each serial port specified in the `fed_ports` dictionary.\n",
    "   - Each thread handles its own serial port and shared resources are managed with thread-safe mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Graceful Thread Termination**:\n",
    "    - Threads check the `stop_event` flag in their loops and exit gracefully when the event is set.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Ensuring GPIO Cleanup**:\n",
    "    - Moved `GPIO.cleanup()` into the `finally` block to ensure it executes regardless of how the script exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Code Organization and Modularity**:\n",
    "    - Organized the code into functions for better readability and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Serial Port Detection**:\n",
    "  - The code still uses hardcoded serial ports. For a more robust solution, consider implementing dynamic detection of connected FED devices or using persistent device naming (e.g., by device ID or symbolic links).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exception Handling**:\n",
    "  - In the `read_from_fed` function, exceptions are logged but the thread continues running unless a critical error occurs, ensuring robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logging Levels**:\n",
    "  - Adjust the logging level in `logging.basicConfig()` to control the verbosity of the logs (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python Version**:\n",
    "  - Added the shebang line `#!/usr/bin/env python3` at the top of the script to specify that it should be run with Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Thread Cleanup**:\n",
    "  - The main thread waits for all worker threads to finish by calling `t.join()` on each thread after setting the `stop_event`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resource Management**:\n",
    "  - The serial port is closed in the `finally` block, ensuring that it is closed even if an error occurs during execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please replace `/dev/ttyACM0` and `FED1` in the `fed_ports` dictionary with the actual serial ports and identifiers for your devices.\n"

    "### **Instructions and Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Install Required Python Packages**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the script, ensure that the required Python packages are installed on your Raspberry Pi:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip3 install pyudev\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter any permission issues, you might need to run the command with `sudo`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo pip3 install pyudev\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's generally better to avoid using `sudo` with `pip3` to prevent installing packages as root.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Ensure Devices Are Properly Connected**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **FED3 Devices**: Connect your FED3 devices to the Raspberry Pi via USB. Ensure that they are powered on and that their SD cards are inserted.\n",
    "- **Auto-Mounting**: The Raspberry Pi should automatically mount the storage partitions of the FED3 devices. You can check this by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  lsblk -o NAME,MOUNTPOINT\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  You should see entries corresponding to your FED3 devices with mount points.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Permissions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Serial Port Access**: Ensure that the user running the script (e.g., `pi`) is a member of the `dialout` group to access serial ports.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  sudo usermod -a -G dialout pi\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mount Point Access**: Ensure that the script has permission to read the `DeviceNumber.csv` files on the mounted devices. Typically, the `pi` user should have access if the devices are auto-mounted under `/media/pi/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Test the Script**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Run the Script**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  python3 /path/to/your/script.py\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  Replace `/path/to/your/script.py` with the actual path to the script file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Observe the Logs**: The script will output logs to the console. Look for messages indicating that devices have been mapped and that threads have been started for each device.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interact with FED3 Devices**: Perform some actions on the FED3 devices to generate events. The script should process these events and send the appropriate TTL signals via the GPIO pins.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Verify GPIO Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hardware Setup**: Ensure that the GPIO pins are connected to your TDT system or another method to monitor the TTL signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Monitor the Signals**: Use an oscilloscope, logic analyzer, or LED indicators to verify that the TTL signals are being sent as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6. Potential Issues and Troubleshooting**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Devices Not Found**: If the script reports \"No FED3 devices found,\" ensure that the devices are connected, powered on, and mounted. Check that the `DeviceNumber.csv` files exist and are accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Permissions Errors**: If you encounter permission errors, double-check that the user running the script has the necessary group memberships and access rights.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mount Points Not Detected**: If the script cannot find the mount points of the devices, you might need to adjust the `get_mount_point` function or ensure that the devices are mounted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attribute Errors**: If the script cannot retrieve attributes like `serial` or `mountpoint`, ensure that the `pyudev` library is working correctly and that the devices expose the necessary information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **7. Adjusting for Your Environment**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mount Points**: If your devices are mounted under a different directory (e.g., `/media/username/`), you may need to adjust the script to reflect that.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Serial Numbers and Device Attributes**: If the devices do not expose serial numbers or if the serial numbers do not match between the serial interface and the storage interface, you may need to find alternative attributes to match the devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **8. Running the Script on Startup**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once you have confirmed that the script works as expected, you can set it up to run automatically on boot using a `systemd` service, as previously discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Final Thoughts**\n",
    "\n",
    "This script should enable you to automatically detect all connected FED3 devices, map them to their respective device numbers by reading the `DeviceNumber.csv` files, and handle events accordingly, all without the need for manual intervention or connected peripherals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please test the script with your devices and let me know if you encounter any issues or need further assistance. I'm here to help!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Be sure to replace `/path/to/your/script.py` with the actual path where you save the script on your Raspberry Pi.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** Always ensure that your hardware connections are safe and that you're not risking any damage to your devices or Raspberry Pi when connecting GPIO pins and other peripherals."
