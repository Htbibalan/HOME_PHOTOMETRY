To ensure that power management and automatic session logout are fully disabled on your Raspberry Pi, you can follow these steps:

### 1. **Disable Power Management via `xset`**
You can use `xset` to disable the Display Power Management Signaling (DPMS) and screen blanking. This ensures that the display stays active even if there's no user interaction.

- Open a terminal and run the following commands to disable screen blanking and DPMS:

```bash
xset s off          # Disable screen saver
xset -dpms          # Disable DPMS (Energy Star) features
xset s noblank      # Disable screen blanking
```

To make these settings persistent (so they apply after reboot), add these commands to your autostart file:

- Open the autostart file:

```bash
nano ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart
```

- Add the following lines at the end of the file:

```bash
@xset s off
@xset -dpms
@xset s noblank
```

- Save the file (`Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`).

### 2. **Disable Power Management via `lightdm`**
If you're using the LightDM display manager, you can disable power management features there as well:

- Open the `lightdm.conf` file by typing:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
```

- Find the section `[Seat:*]` and add or modify the following line:

```bash
xserver-command=X -s 0 -dpms
```

This prevents the X server from activating screen saver or DPMS (power-saving) features.

- Save the file (`Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, and press `Enter`).

### 3. **Disable Automatic Session Logout**
You can modify the LightDM settings to disable automatic session timeouts:

- Open the session settings file by running:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
```

- Under the `[Seat:*]` section, ensure that there are no session timeout settings like the following. If present, remove or comment them out:

```bash
session-timeout=0
```

- You can also check the `idle timeout` settings:

```bash
idle-timeout=0
```

This setting disables any idle timeout that could log out the session.

### 4. **Disable System Suspend (Power Management)**
If the Raspberry Pi is suspending or hibernating due to inactivity (rare, but can happen in certain setups), you can disable suspend mode.

- Open the power management settings:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/logind.conf
```

- Find the following lines and uncomment (remove the `#`) and set the values as shown below:

```bash
#HandleLidSwitch=ignore
#HandleLidSwitchDocked=ignore
#HandleSuspendKey=ignore
#HandleHibernateKey=ignore
#IdleAction=ignore
```

This disables any automatic suspend, hibernation, or power-saving behavior.

- Save the file (`Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, and press `Enter`).

- Restart the service to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind
```

### 5. **Reboot**
Finally, reboot your Raspberry Pi to apply all changes:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

This setup should fully disable power management and automatic session logout, ensuring that your system stays active even if there's no user interaction or if you turn off the screen.
